# Astroad

Astroad is a pre-configured setup for Astro and Payloadcms, designed to make it easy for you to start building your website. With Astroad, you'll have a complete development environment that you can run locally using Docker. This setup simplifies the testing and development of your website before deploying it to a production environment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Astroad, make sure you have the necessary software installed:

- Docker
- Node.js
- Yarn

## Configuration

While there's no configuration necessary for local development, deployment via Github Workflows requires specific secrets and variables to be set.
Secrets:

- USER: User on the server
- HOST: IP or URL of the server
- KEY: SSH KEY for connecting to the server
- MONGODB_PW: Password for MongoDB
- MONGODB_USER: User for MongoDB
- PATH: Path where the repository resides on the server
- PAYLOAD_PORT: Port at which Payload listens
- PAYLOAD_SECRET: String to encrypt Payload data
- TOKEN: Github Access Token for the webhook to trigger the payload.yml workflow and execute a new Astro build

Variables:

- ASTRO_HOST: Hostdomain of the Frontend
- PAYLOAD_HOST: Hostdomain of the CMS
- PAYLOAD_URL: URL of the CMS
- NAME: Name of the Container and Project

Please remember to set these secrets and variables in your repository settings to ensure a successful deployment through Github Workflows.

Once the secrets and variables are set on GitHub, they will replace the existing ones in the .env file on the server during deployment. This is done by the push.yml workflow, which replaces the placeholders in the .env with the actual secrets and variables defined in the repository settings. Please ensure that the names of your secrets and variables match with the placeholders in the .env file.

## Getting started

To get started with Astroad, you'll need to have Docker and NPM || Yarn || PNPM installed on your machine.

You have two options for getting the repository:

1. Use the 'Use this template' button on the Github repository. This will create a new repository in your Github account with the same directory structure and files as Astroad. After the new repository is created, you can clone it to your local machine.
1. Alternatively, you can directly clone the Astroad repository: git clone https://github.com/mooxl/astroad.git. If you choose this option, remember to change the origin of your remote repository to a new one to avoid pushing changes directly to the Astroad repository. This can be done with the command: git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git where USERNAME is your username and REPOSITORY is the name of your new repository.

Once you've cloned the repository or created your own from the template, follow these steps:

1. Change into the repository directory: `cd {newName}`
1. Start the containers: `yarn dev`

This will start up the Astro, Payloadcms and Mongo containers and make them available on your local machine. Astro will be served at http://localhost:3000 and the Payload will be available at http://localhost:3001.

## Development

The `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-dev.yml` files includes everything you need to run the containers. The containers use the environment variables declared in the `.env` file and mounted volumes to store data persistently even after the containers are stopped and started.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled by a Github Actions Workflow on every push. It logs into the server via SSH, pulls or clones the latest version of the repository, and runs `yarn prod`.

Because Astro is completely static, a content change in the CMS must trigger a new build of Astro. Therefore, thereâ€™s a `payload.yml` workflow that gets triggered by a webhook after every content change from Payload.

Ensure you have Traefik set up as a reverse proxy before deployment. The prod script will launch your site in a production-ready environment.
