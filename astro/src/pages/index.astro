      Astroad is a pre-configured setup for Astro and Payloadcms that makes it
      easy to get started with building your website. With Astroad, you'll have
      a complete development environment that you can run locally using Docker.
      This makes it easy to test and develop your website before deploying it to
      a production environment.
      <br />
      When you're ready to deploy the website on your own server, Astrotus comes
      with a production environment that requires the use of Traefik as a reverse
      proxy. This setup provides a secure and scalable production environment for
      your website.
